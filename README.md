# 👋 Hey, I'm James Witcher

I'm a marketing data scientist with a passion for solving tough, messy problems — especially where consumer behavior meets analytics. I’ve worked at Nike, adidas, and Intel, using Python, SQL, Javascript, and tools like Databricks and Snowflake to turn massive datasets into actionable insights.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- **Marketing & consumer analytics** at scale
- Building dashboards and tools for internal and public use (see [Retail Trend Tracker](https://retail-trend-tracker.vercel.app/))
- Teaching forecasting fundamentals to non-technical teams
- Leveling up in **Azure**, **data engineering**, and **cloud architecture**

---
## 📍 Areas of Strength
- **Marketing & Customer Analytics** — Segmentation, Attribution, CLV, Loyalty Engagement
- **Forecasting & Experimentation** — XGBoost, Prophet, MMM, SQL-based baselining
- **Dashboards & Automation** — Databricks, Python, SQL, Plotly, Vercel
---

## 🧠 Interests
- Demand forecasting & media mix modeling
- Customer segmentation and personalization
- Full-stack data apps (from pipeline to dashboard)
- Open-source trend tracking tools

---

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On
